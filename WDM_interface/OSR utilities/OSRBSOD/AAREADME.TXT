What Is It?
------------
If you've ever tried writing a kernel mode driver for NT, you've
seen THIS before:  The infamous Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD).  Then
again, if you've even RUN Windows NT for very long you've probably
seen it.

Ever since a student in out of our classes suggested this, we
couldn't stop thinking about writing it.  Now, one of the OSR
staff who's either brighter or less busy or more disturbed than
the rest of us has made it a reality.

Amaze your friends.  Freak-out your enemies.


How Does It Work?
------------------
The screen saver actually uses the Direct-X API to write the
image to the screen.  Neat, eh?  Note that every time you run
the screen saver a different, and very authentic, crash message
appears.


How To Install
--------------
Just copy the image OSRBSOD.SCR to your %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32
directory, and then select "OSR's Blue Screen of Death" in the
usual way you select a screen saver (either from the Control
Panel's Display applet, clicking the screen saver tab -- or
right mouse-clicking on the desktop, selecting properties,
and THEN clicking the screen saver tab).
