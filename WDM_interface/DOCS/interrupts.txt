Gordon,

There's a LOT you're not allowed to do in interrupts, starting with calling
anything that the DDK docs indicate is callable at <= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

Accessing the config space at >DISPATCH_LEVEL (like in an ISR) is almost
certainly incorrect.  What method are you using to access the config space?

Also, you're looking for examples - what PCI interface device are you using?
