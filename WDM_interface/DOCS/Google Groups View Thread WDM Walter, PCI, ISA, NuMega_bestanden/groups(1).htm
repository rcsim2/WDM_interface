  <BR></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><PRE>First time driver writer here...any help would be
greatly appreciated.  I really respect what you
guys do after working on this.

I'm writing a driver to support our PCI and ISA
boards using NuMega's DriverWorks.  I created a
project with their WDM Driver Wizard and got it
working with our PCI board in no time.

Now I'm trying to make the driver talk to our ISA
board too.  I know it's not PNP so I am going
down the wrong path?

Can my driver support multiple DeviceObject
types?  I'm getting some nasty crashes here.

All I have to do is issue one IOCTL code and
request system resources for this ISA device,
which isn't software configurable, so I only need
some I/O addresses.  The way DriverWorks is setup
though, it seems like it will only work with PNP
devices, derived from their KPnpDevice.  Can I
fool it somehow or what?

I've looked through Walter Oney's book and there
is no mention of ISA anywhere, maybe because WDM
rely on PNP?

Thanks.

Not at all. Just tell the PnP manager what the ISA card's resource
alternatives are by means of a LogConfig section in your INF file.

If both ISA and PCI cards use the same style for DMA, the same width for
ports and memory-mapped registers, and the same style of interrupt
handling, the same driver should just work for both configurations.
(Even with interrupts, if you just copy the code from my book, you won't
care about differences between edge/level triggering or interrupt
sharing -- the PnP Manager knows all and tells you in
IRP_MN_START_DEVICE.)

If some of these details are different, I advise you to avoid the
temptation to conditionally compile one driver for either thing or (even
worse) to put runtime decision making in. Such drivers are much harder
to maintain because they accumulate dead code, unforseen special cases,
etc. Just build two separate drivers and cut and paste code.

It's just that which bus you're on is no longer very important. Even
when setting up DMA, you can call somebody else to find out what kind of
bus you're dealing with. Check out PIOFAKE, for example, which is a
driver for a (non-existent) legacy device that could, in principle, be
on a PCI, ISA, EISA, or MCI bus or on a PCMCIA card. Absolutely nothing
about that driver cares, which is one of the great advantages of PnP.

You will need a FactDef section in your INF as well, or you will have
problems with loading and/or reboots.

When the user goes through the Add New Hardware wizard, registry entries
are created for the so-called "root enumerator", which is responsible
for "detecting" legacy hardware. The root enumerator creates the PDO and
responds to IRP_MJ_PNP requests that cause the PnP manager to load your
driver and call its AddDevice function.

Trust me! Just put the LogConfig in your INF and leave it up to the PnP
Manager! You don't need any of this complication in your driver any
more.

Think about it: a lot of the hardware on your computer is "legacy" in
the sense that it has no electronic way to announce its presence to the
OS. Furthermore, Microsoft hasn't (yet) forbidden consumers from buying
legacy devices. They *had* to provide an easy way for people to write
drivers, and they did. You just have to start thinking passive (let the
system tell you what to do) instead of active (find your hardware,
configure it, tell the system what to do).

<FONT color=#660066>&gt; Our ISA boards have jumper settings to select base I/O address, so it's

Right. And the hardware wizard will assume that the user has to change
those jumpers after installing the driver. That's why you get a dialog
showing resource assignments (after resolving conflicts) and
instructions to shut the system down to install the card. All your user
has to do is install the driver, follow your instructions for setting
the jumpers based on the assigned resources, and install the card.

Also in handling IRP_MN_START_DEVICE, I was able to follow Walter's

Boy is this MUCH easier than the road I was travelling...thanks again.
