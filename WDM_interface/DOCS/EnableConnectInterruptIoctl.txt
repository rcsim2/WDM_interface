Took the rough approach -- created the value at 5 places at once,
found it working, and then started deleting them one by one until it
failed again.

It's the 'Device Parameters' subkey.  Not illogical of course, but the
docs might have mentioned it instead of just saying "under the Plug
and Play registry key for the parallel port" ;-)
