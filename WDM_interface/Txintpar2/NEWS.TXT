Parsimp and Win2000

Is there anyone who has managed to get the parsimp sample (from the NT4 DDK)
to run on Win2000 with #define INTERRUPT_NEEDED 1 uncommented?

I have enabled interrupts on the parallel port and I'm using Thesycon's UPPDEMO to make sure my device is generating interrupts. I then do a CreateFile() from a Win32 app and use Sysinternals Dbgview to check whether ParInterruptService() ever gets called. Which it does not.

In Thesycon's UPPDEMO's History (in the ReadMe file), mention is made of a "Bug fix for interrupt handling on Windows 2000" and they are using different drivers for NT4 and Win2000. From this I surmise that Win2000 indeed handles parallel port interrupts differently than NT4 and that this probably causes the parsimp sample not to work on Win2000. Can anyone confirm this?

Finally, does anyone know of parallel port driver which handles interrupts (like Thesycon's UPPDEMO) which is freeware and open source?

Regards
